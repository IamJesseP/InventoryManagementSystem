# InventoryManagementSystem
A Windows Forms Application (.NET Framework) inventory management application written in C#. The program executes everything in memory and does not use a database. 
Using the buttons beneath the appropriate tables, users can add, delete, and modify parts and products. The Delete and Search functions are the same for both Products and Parts.
